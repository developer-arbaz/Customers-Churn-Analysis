Executive Summary:
This analysis explores customer churn in a telecom company using the "Telco-Customer-Churn" dataset. The key findings and visualizations created in the analysis provide insights into customer behavior, with an emphasis on factors contributing to churn. Below are the key observations from the generated charts:

Churn Distribution:

A countplot reveals the distribution of customers who have churned versus those who haven't. The pie chart further highlights the percentage of customers who have churned, offering a clear view of churn rates in the dataset.
Churn by Gender:

The countplot visualizing churn by gender shows a relatively equal distribution of churn across both male and female customers. This suggests that gender does not have a significant impact on churn.
Senior Citizen Impact:

A countplot focused on senior citizens shows how many senior citizens are part of the customer base. A stacked bar chart further reveals the percentage of churn by senior citizens. This indicates that senior citizens are more likely to churn compared to non-senior citizens.
Tenure vs Churn:

A histogram of tenure vs churn demonstrates that customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn. It indicates the importance of improving retention strategies for new customers.
Churn by Contract Type:

The countplot visualizing churn by contract type reveals that customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those with one or two-year contracts.
Churn and Services:

Multiple countplots were created to analyze churn by various services such as PhoneService, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, and more. These charts suggest that customers using services like PhoneService, InternetService (especially DSL), and OnlineSecurity are less likely to churn. Conversely, churn rates are significantly higher for customers who lack services like OnlineBackup, TechSupport, and StreamingTV.
Churn by Payment Method:

A countplot showing churn by payment method reveals that customers using electronic checks as a payment method are more likely to churn. This could suggest that alternative payment methods may be more favorable in reducing churn.
Key Insights:
Customer Tenure plays a significant role in churn, with newer customers more likely to leave.
Contract Type impacts churn, with month-to-month contracts exhibiting higher churn rates.
Service Usage: Access to services such as PhoneService, InternetService, and OnlineSecurity correlates with lower churn rates, while lack of services like OnlineBackup and TechSupport increases churn.
Payment Method: Customers using electronic checks are more likely to churn, suggesting a possible area for targeted retention efforts.
